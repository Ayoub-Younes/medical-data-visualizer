# Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
The Data Visualization Project is a Python-based application that utilizes Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize cardiovascular health data. This project processes a dataset to derive insights related to cardiovascular risk factors, including cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). It provides visual representations through categorical plots and heatmaps, allowing users to easily interpret relationships and trends in the data.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used to load, clean, and transform the dataset.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on Matplotlib, used for creating informative and attractive visualizations.
Matplotlib: A plotting library that provides the foundation for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
NumPy: A library for numerical operations in Python, used for efficient computation in the heatmap function.
